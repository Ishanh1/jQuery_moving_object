Hey guise this my JQuery first project on github If you want to learn about jQuery Project leave a comment for me that's motivational for me.
First of all if you want to using jQuery in task in locally, so you have to insert jQuery uncompressed file in his project folder where you store his jQery file link https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.js .
Save this file in your Project folder.
Add jQuery file in his <head> <script src="jquery.js"> </script> </head>, After completed this used his jQuery codes in <script></script>.
After writing his HTML code in body then you will use jQuery predefined function in jQuery.
